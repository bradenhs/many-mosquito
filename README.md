## What is Zilch?

Zilch helps novices and experts alike level up their coding skills with a suite of engaging games. These games are played by bots - bots you think up, design, and program. Lectures and textbooks have their place, but real learning? That requires problems without prescribed solutions in the back of a book. Zilch aims to provide the best problems possible: approachable, competitive, open-ended, fun, playable problems; problems won with the bots you build.
